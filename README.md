# ServoControl Project

## Overview

The **ServoControl Project** is an Arduino-based library designed to simplify the control of multiple servos with varying specifications. This project provides a robust framework for initializing, rotating, and resetting servos, enabling developers to integrate servo control into their embedded systems with ease.

**Note**: These servo motors are controlled by the **ESP32** microcontroller **without a driver board** (Waveshare ST3215 Servo motor).

### Features

- Supports multiple servos with customizable parameters (maximum angle, speed, torque).
- Smooth rotation to specified angles.
- Automatic return to the initial position after reaching the maximum angle.
- Simple interface for initialization and control.
